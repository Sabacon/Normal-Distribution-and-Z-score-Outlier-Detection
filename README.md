# Normal Distribution & Z-score Outlier Detection.

## Background
I created this notebook to provide an overview of the **normal distribution** as it is the most common continuous probability distribution.

I used the `Age` column of the `HR Employee Attrition` dataset to explore this distribution. I picked this column simply because it appeared normally distributed in a project I was working on.

## Tools
* pandas
* numpy
* statsmodels
* scipy
* seaborn
